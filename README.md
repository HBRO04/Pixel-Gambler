This project is a casino-themed prototype developed in Godot 4.5, created as a hands-on exercise to advance my proficiency with GDScript.
The game showcases a suite of mini-games, allowing players to experience Blackjack, Slot Machines, Horse Race Betting, a Prize Wheel, and a Hi-Lo Dice game.
I was also responsible for the visual style, having designed all the in-game pixel art assets using Pixel Studio.
